JSP lifecycle methods are:

jspInit(): This method is declared in JspPage and it’s implemented by JSP container implementations.
This method is called once in the JSP lifecycle to initialize it with config params configured in deployment descriptor.
We can override this method using JSP declaration scripting element to initialize any resources that we want to use in JSP page.

jspService(): This is the JSP method that gets invoked by JSP container for each client request by passing request
and response object. Notice that method name starts with underscore to distinguish it from other lifecycle methods 
because we can’t override this method. All the JSP code goes inside this method and it’s overridden by default.
We should not try to override it using JSP declaration scripting element. This method is defined in HttpJspPage interface.

jspDestroy(): This method is called by container when JSP is unloaded from memory such as shutting down application or container.
This method is called only once in JSP lifecycle and we should override this method to release any resources
created in JSP init method.
